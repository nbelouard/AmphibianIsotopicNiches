# Description

Local isotopic niche partitioning and the coexistence between native amphibians and invasive crayfish 

Invasive species are widely reported to cause local extinctions of native species. The red swamp crayfish, _Procambarus clarkii_, has been repeatedly shown to impact amphibians through predation and competition. Studying species isotopic niches in natural ecosystems where this crayfish coexists with native amphibians is a way to test our comprehension of the mechanisms underlying species coexistence.  

This package contains all the data and R code associated with an article currently submitted to Journal of Animal Ecology.

## Clone this project locally

Open your R Terminal, and set the working directory to the folder where you want the project to be stored using cd. Then, type:

```
git clone git@gitlab.com:nbelouard/coexistence_isoniches.git
```

## Access and reproduce this analysis

If you wish to reproduce the analyses, once the project is cloned locally:
- access the folder and open the coexistence_isoniches.Rproj file to open the project in Rstudio
- install the package using the R button "install and restart" in the Build tab of Rstudio. 


You can manually access the analyses by opening the vignettes (folder vignettes/).
Or you can automatically run all the vignettes and build a site by using 
```
pkgdown::build_site()
```
